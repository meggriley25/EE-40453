This results in the sine wave appearing in the output. After applying the correction, we are able to cancel out the nonideality and just see the 1’s from the original signal."

As an extension of Lab 02, BER is calculated by comparing the transmitted sequence of bits to the received bits and counting the number of errors. Our BER tests wired communication system was much easier and we were able to acheive a 0 error rate on the first or second try. The BER test for the wireless communication took numerous trial and errors to make sure the atennas were orienties the same way, same height, and a close distance. During this exercise we had to try several different antennas before we were finally successful."
