In the end, we will introduce the Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK).\n",

As an extension of Lab 02, BER is calculated by comparing the transmitted sequence of bits to the received bits and counting the number of errors. Our BER tests wired communication system was much easier and we were able to acheive a 0 error rate on the first or second try. The BER test for the wireless communication took numerous trial and errors to make sure the atennas were orienties the same way, same height, and a close distance. During this exercise we had to try several different antennas before we were finally successful."

    "In Lab 07, we experimented and observed non-coherent demodulation and frame synchronization. The first step of this process was to develop an algorithm for preamble detection using cross-correlation. Frame arrival detections allow us to detect a data frame's arrival and approximate the frame starting position. Then we developed an algorithm for non-coherent demodulation of baseband OOK symbols by comparing energies. The function allowed us to determine what the received sequence of bits will be from several different noisy samples corresponding to 1 bit, and by taking the average energy of these samples, we can compare it to the threshold to determine if the received bit should be a 1 or a 0. In the third exercise, we integrate and unit test a frame synchronization block. The frame synchronization output returns the location(s) of the payload beginning. Then we integrate and unit test the non-coherent demodulation block. The output will return the transmitted OOK bit/symbol state, which determines if the signal is on or off. In the final exercise, we test and verify the system by checking the BER to determine the quality of the communication system, where 0 indicates no errors. \n",

Although our demonstration simplifies the model and assumes non-idealities (hardware such as I, Q imbalance, and DC offsets presented in the final received signal) were taken care of by the software calibration and pre-processing process. The real-world applications start with frame synchronization to detect the preamble sequence and use the preamble to help us identify the boundary between the preamble and the rest of the packets. And then, they can perform the non-coherent demodulation and decoding of the header and the payload portion of the packet."

    "For this lab we implemented the mathematical formulas for receiving signals using Python. In exercise 1, we wrote a code to detect the preamble. We implemented a matched filter using cross correlation and then plotted the peaks. The peaks were approximately at the start of the preamble. In exercise 2, we wrote a code for demodulating OOK symbols. After computing the average energy of noisy samples corresponding to 1 bit, we compared the energy to the threshold to determine if the mostly likely transmitted bit was a 1 or a 0. In exercise 3, we tested our logic from exercise 1 to see if it could detect a known preamble rather than a random sequence. In exercise 4, we tested our logic from exercise 2 to see if it could accurately demodulate a signal. In exercise 5, we set up wired/wireless communication systems and tried to obtain a bit error rate of 0 for both setups. \n",

A lot of time was spent trying to mess with the computer/setup when in reality there was an issue with the power connections. Unfortunately even after we got that fixed, getting a BER of 0 took a ton of trial and error while changing nothing, which was frustrating. In the end we borrowed another group's antennas. \n",

On this lab we explored delay as a non-ideality, but in practice a real-world channel might also have a frequency shift, attenuation, and God knows what. One of the things I remember learning in a club project was the Doppler effect. I assume this effect is accounted for with the methods presented in class and lightly explored in-lab."
