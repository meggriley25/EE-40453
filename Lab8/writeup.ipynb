Most of the modules have been shown and discussed in previous labs and have the same functionality as before, so we only highlight the functionality of the two new modules here.\n",

    "#### Frequency & Phase Sync\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency and phase sync modules compute estimates of the frequency and phase offsets of the received baseband signal so that they could be corrected before coherent demodulation & symbol demodulation. The estimation of the carrier frequency offset is obtained via the Fourier transform whereas the carrier phase offset is estimated by extracting the angle/phase from the complex exponential formed by the I and Q channel signals.\n",

    "Using the samples with timing, frequency and phase correction applied, the coherent demodulator performs coherent demodulation of the received signal based on the minimum distance / maximum likelihood detection. All bits of the demodulated packets are packed in an array and sent to the Data Sink."

    "\n",
    "where: $A$ is some scaling factor of the received complex BB signal, $T$ is the sampling period of the ADC, $\\hat{s}[nT]$ represents the complex baseband signal that was originally transmitted, and the variables $\\Delta f$ and $\\Delta \\varphi$ represent the unknown carrier frequency offset and carrier phase offset. These two offset values remain unknown and changing from packet to packet due to the random drift of two local oscillators. In order to peform coherent demodulation and correct the frequecny and phase offset of the BB signals, we need to know/estimate the carrier frequency offset $\\Delta f$ and phase offset $\\Delta \\varphi$. In the following two sub-sections, we are going to demonstrate how the frequency and phase offsets could be estimated.\n",

    "After expansion (note that $\\hat{s}[nT] = s_I[nT] + j \\cdot s_Q[nT]$), we have:\n",

    "### Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to obtaining an estimate of the carrier frequency offset is to compute the fast Fourier transform (FFT) magnitude response of the preamble samples and look for the frequency $\\hat{\\Delta f}$ corresponding to the peak of the FFT magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this method is adopted, it is important to note that an appropriate FFT size or amount of zero-padding may be needed in order to achieve the desired frequency resolution, i.e., size of each frequency bin. For example, if in our communication system the ADC sampling rate is $f_{in} = 1 MHz$ and the preamble samples are zero-padded to $N=100,000$ points. Then the frequency resolution of the FFT output will be given by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{FFT\\ Frequency\\ Resolution} = \\frac{f_{in}}{N} = 10\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we would like to estimate the carrier frequency offset more accurately, e.g., in the order of 10 Hz, we need more data points in the FFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Carrier Phase Offset (CPO) Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how the carrier phase offset can be estimated, let us first assume that by performing FFT on the preamble samples we are able to obtain an estimate of the carrier frequency offset, $\\hat{\\Delta f}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then generate a complex LO for demodulation purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{LO}[n] = e^{- j2\\pi \\hat{\\Delta f} nT} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we multiply the received complex signal with the LO and note that our preamble is OOK modulated (original signal only has I component), we will obtain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{x}[n] \\cdot \\hat{LO}[n]  = r_I[n] + j \\cdot r_Q[n]$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$r_Q[n] = A sin(2\\pi \\Delta f n T - 2\\pi \\hat{\\Delta f} n T  + \\Delta \\varphi) s_I[nT] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the estimate of carrier frequency offset is close enough such that $\\Delta f - \\hat{\\Delta f} $ is small, we approximately have:\n",

    "$$f(\\rho | \\mathbf{s}_i) = \\prod_{k=1}^{N} f(\\rho_k | s_{ik})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\rho | \\mathbf{s}_i) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{N/2}} e^{-||\\rho-\\mathbf{s}_i||^2/2\\sigma^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum likelihood (ML) detection thus requires us to find the choice of $\\mathbf{s}_i$ that maximizes the expression above, which is equivalent to the following minimum distance decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{s}_k = \\underset{\\mathbf{s}_i}{\\arg\\min}\\ ||\\rho -  \\mathbf{s}_i ||$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matched Filtering and Sampling for Demodulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmit side pulse shaping is often combined with a receive side *matched filter* to maximize the SNR of the received signal, and to achieve the optimum tolerance for noise in the system. This is illustrated in the figure below in both CT and DT, again with symbol period $T_s$ seconds and oversampling factor $N_s$ samples per symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![matched](images/matched-filtering.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the matched filter, consider a transmit filter $p(t) \\leftrightarrow P(f)$ and arbitrary receive filter $q(t) \\leftrightarrow Q(f)$. It can be shown that the optimal choice of the transfer function of the receive filter is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_{mf}(t) = A\\ p^*(-t) \\leftrightarrow Q_{mf}(f) = A\\ P^*(f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is an arbitrary constant, but often chose to be $A=1$ for simplicity. Sampling the output of this matched filter at time $t=0$ implements the correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(t)p^*(t) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(f) P^*(f) df$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the energy of the transmit pulse shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above discussion, the transmit and receive filters combine to create a zero-phase system, which will in general be non-causal. To make the system causal and therefore practically implementable, we can introduce a delay $\\tau_1>0$ in the transmit pulse $p(t-\\tau_1)$ and delay $\\tau_2>0$ in the matched filter $q_{mf}(t-\\tau_2)=p^*(\\tau_2-t)$. In this case, the output of the matched filter will correspond to its maximum of the transmit pulse energy if we sample at time $t=\\tau_1 + \\tau_2$, i.e., the overall delay through the system is $\\tau_1 + \\tau_2$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In our implementation the pulse shaping is equally distributed between the sender and receiver filters by utilizing two root raised-cosine filters which together gives an impulse response of a raised-cosine filter. Note that a root raised-raised cosine filter is a matched filter of itself. If we delay each filter by $LT$ seconds and truncate to make it causal as outlined above, the overall delay through the transmit and receive filters together will be $2LT$ seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbol Demodulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbol demodulation, which is also referred to as symbol decoding or symbol-to-bit mapping, converts the downsampled matched filter outputs, which can be viewed as degraded constellation symbol sequences, back to bit sequences. Often symbol demodulation implements the maximum likelihood (ML) detector or a low-complexity approximation to it. Due to the presence of noise as well as other factors such as residual errors in carrier frequency and phase estimations, the downsampled matched filter outputs are distributed around the transmitted symbols in the constellation diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete-time equivalent channels modeled by AWGN, the ML decision rule is simply to choose the constellation symbol that is closest to the downsampled matched filter output, i.e., the minimum distance detector. Specifically, if we model the downsampled match-filter output sample\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{s}_i + \\mathbf{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{s}_i$, $i=1,2,\\ldots,N$, denotes the symbols in the constellation, $N$ is the total number of constellation points, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the noise introduced to the data transmission by the AWGN channel, and $\\mathbf{r}$ is the received symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of receiving the symbol $\\mathbf{r}$ given that the symbol $\\mathbf{s}_i$ is transmitted can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{s}_i) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{N/2}} e^{-||\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}_i||^2/2\\sigma^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ here is the dimension of the signal space (or the number of bases for each symbol). For example, in the case of QPSK modulation scheme, the I and Q axes form two bases ($\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{T_s}}\\cos(2\\pi ft)$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{T_s}}\\sin(2\\pi ft)$ where $T_s$ is the symbol period).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML and minimum distance decision rule therefore decides on the transmitted symbol via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{ \\mathbf{s} } = \\underset{\\mathbf{s}_i,i=1,2,\\ldots,N}{\\arg\\min}\\ ||\\mathbf{r}  -  \\mathbf{s}_i ||$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the decision rule requires us to choose the symbols that are closest to the received symbols, we can draw what are known as the decision regions in the constellation diagram. For example, the figures below show the decision regions for 4-PAM and 16-QAM modulation schemes.\n",
