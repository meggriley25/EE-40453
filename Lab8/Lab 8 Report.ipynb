    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to realize the coherent communication between our Tx & Rx stations by building upon the previous lab and implementing two more functional modules: the frequency & phase synchronization module and the coherent demodulation module combing the matched filter. In the end, we will introduce the Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK).\n",

    "## Outline\n",
    "- Develop an algorithm for frequency offset estimation using FFT.\n",
    "- Develop an algorithm for phase offset estimation by calculating the average of phase angles of received preamble samples. \n",
    "- Integrate and unit test the Frequency offset estimation block.\n",
    "- Integrate and unit test the Phase offset estimation block.\n",

The function performs the cross correlation / matched-filtering based frame synchronization by match filtering the received, zero-mean / ac-coupled data with the matched filter response. The output is the crosscorrelation / Matched filtering result that is then fed to the peak search function which returns the location(s) of the payload beginning.\n",
